 * Manages "testing" interaction -

 *   1) You draw a letter with your finger and tell Joshua when you're done
 *   2) Joshua make a best guess based on what you taught him
 *   3) If he's right, the game repeats
 *   4) If he's wrong, Joshua learns this as a negative example for his guess and tries again
